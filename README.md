#tournament

This project is demonstrating
1. creation of sql data structures with tournament.sql and
2. use of the database to store player and match information
3. the tournament.py code can be used to create and delete players and matches.
it can also be used to pair players of equal ability.

The exercise was to set up a vagrant virtual linux machine and sql server and then use that server.
this virtual machine is operating system independant as it runs linux in a stand alone process
